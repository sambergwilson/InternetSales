# Project Name
InternetSales

# Description
This project was built as my first fully functional Portfolio Project. My inspiration was to help solve a problem for a family member to help store the information for the customers they work with. What was sold with the owners name, business name, and address. 

# Usage
This is just a very simple application to create new customer with an edit and delete function for the database. I created a search so if you have 50 customers you could look for someone specific. 

# What I used to complete this project
Here are the tools I used to complete my project.
* bootswatch.com/morph / bootstrap
* javascript functions for my Modal
* Entity Framework
* .NET 7


Thank you for checking out my first portfolio project.
